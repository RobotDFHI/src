                    the smartphone will make sure that the Robot move:
                      Move forward 
                      Move Back
                      Turn right
                      Turn Left
                      Accelerate

<h2>Installing</h2><hr/>
  To install Ionic we have to check if we have:
    <ul>
      <li>Nodejs install on our machine</li>
      <li>npm install on it</li>
      <li>Android studio</li>
    </ul>
    
    Before that we can install ionic with cordova with the command:
       $ npm install -g ionic cordova
       
       Once thatâ€™s done, create your first Ionic app:

        $ ionic start firstCode
        
        <strong>cd </strong> into the directory that was created and then run the <strong>ionic serve </strong> command to test your app           right in the browser!
        $ cd firstCode
        $ ionic serve
